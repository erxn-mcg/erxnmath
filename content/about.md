I am a y11 student hoping to study maths at uni, with a particular passion for number theory and the basics of applied mathematics.
My love for mathematics began _properly_ after watching a lecture by James Maynard {my literal hero} on prime numbers and the twin prime conjecture. This led me to read over some of his papers, admittedly i understood very little, but these papers helped open the door to a fascination with numbers and mathematical proofs. Aside from ideas such as prime numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis in number theory, I also love to explore the mathematics of space, time, and space-time!

This blog is an opportunity for me to further my mathematical knowedge by researching and writing about different areas of maths which catch my attention. From the golden ratio to quantum computing, this is a mish-mash of everything to do with numbers :)

Also, in the tiny chance that you are James Maynard reading this - can i have an autograph??
