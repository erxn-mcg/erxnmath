## Introduction

Prime numbers are arguably the **most** important numbers in mathematics - and for good reason! Primes are the basic building blocks of our number system, much like how letters are the building blocks of words. In fact, primes are so important that many number theorists will dedicate their entire careers to exploring interesting theories about their quantity and distribution.

What is a prime number? This may be a very simple question, but it is very important that the answer is considered before we look any deeper into the ideas of primes. 
> A prime number is defined as being a number greater than 1 which has only two factors: 1 and itself. This means that it is unable to be broken up into smaller integers in the form 'm x n', so cannot be factored. 

There is often confusion over whether 1 is a prime number or not: 1 is not considered to be a prime number by most mathematicians because it would prove to be an annoying exception to many rules about primes. If 1 were a prime number, then the `fundamental theorem of arithmetic` would have to be changed since it currently states that every `composite` number can be written as a product of primes in 'exactly one way'. If we considered 1 to be a prime, then we could write, for example, the number 15 as `3 x 5`, but we could also write it as `3 x 5 x 1`, or `3 x 5 x 1 x 1`. So you see that 'exactly one way' would have to be taken out, and this would have quite profound consequences for other areas of mathematics. As a result, many mathematicians consider the number 1 to be a special type of number which is neither prime, nor composite!
